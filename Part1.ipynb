    "“Data is the new Oil” is a pretty infamous proverb that has been floating around on the web lately. In this era of Big Data with zettabytes of information is being shared across the network as this new Oil, and we know how rapidly this volume is increasing every single day.\n",

    "Hence for any business to succeed, it is very intrinsic to extract meaningful insights from the data being generated across their platform, be it web or mobile.\n",

    "This demand is extremely high as of today and with the development happening across the globe, we’re pretty sure that any professional in Technology domain with Data Science skills will comfortably sustain for next few decades. \n",

    "Somehow I believe that the value of **Data Visualization** in the Data Science toolkit is constantly being undermined. **Data Science is not all about super cool predictive algorithms and instead in itself “Data Science is a life cycle”.**\n",

    "No matter how well we have pre-processed our data, if we cannot project the inference on to a screen, it won’t make stakeholders happy because they don’t care about our code.\n",

    "**Irrespective of how well our algorithm actually predicts, unless we can project those numbers (preferred in  $ ) efficiently on screen for them to visualize, oh boy, for us “Winter has come”, so get ready to face the Night King. Human brain perceives best, what it can visually comprehend to & if stakeholder/clients could have done that, Harvard Business wouldn’t have ever rated Data Science as the sexiest job of the 21st century.**"

    "And in this process, Statistics plays a very important role, for which we have to READ BOOKS, irrespective of format (Paperback, PDF, whatever). If nothing else, at least read ISLR (Introduction to Statistical Learning), which is a very foundation level book with minimal concepts to kick-start our journey. I shall also add few other resources for reference at the end of this post or in next of this series."

Saved next 5 minutes for something better than reading this article!” & if we couldn’t, then we’re doomed (just kidding!). Lack of such visualization skills isn’t generally with working professionals, but more with the beginners because MOOCs they undertake breeze through Data Visualization topics as if they never even existed, so here is a small attempt to make things little better for those who struggle inferring plots."

Though Seaborn isn’t a core scientific computation package like SciPy, but is extremely efficient with Statistical Data Graphics. Hence, Seaborn is an industry-wise accepted visualization technique, unless a Dashboard is required (even widget option is available though), so below I encompass all the Seaborn offerin"
